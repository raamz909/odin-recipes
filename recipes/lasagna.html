                <li><b>Cook Meat Sauce:                  </b> In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, and sauté until soft. Add ground beef, breaking it apart with a spoon, and cook until browned. Drain excess fat. Stir in marinara sauce, bring to a simmer, and cook for 5 minutes.

Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a third of the mozzarella cheese, and then a layer of meat sauce. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of noodles, meat sauce, and the remaining mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
