                <h2>Description</h2>
                <li><b>Tenderize Meat: </b>Place each pork chop between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound them with a meat mallet until they are about 1/4 inch thick. Season both sides with salt, pepper, and paprika (if using).</li>
                <li><b>Dredge:         </b>Set up three shallow bowls: one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with breadcrumbs. Dredge each pork chop in flour, shaking off any excess. Dip in beaten eggs, then coat with breadcrumbs, pressing gently to adhere.</li>
                <li><b>Fry:            </b>In a large skillet, heat a generous amount of vegetable oil (enough to come up 1/2 inch up the sides of the pan) over medium-high heat. Fry the schnitzels for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Do not overcrowd the pan; cook in batches if necessary.</li>
                <li><b>Serve:          </b>Drain the schnitzels on paper towels to remove excess oil. Serve hot with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the schnitzels.</li>
