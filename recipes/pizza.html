        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce (preferably homemade or high-quality store-bought)</li>
            <li>1 cup Fior di Latte mozzarella, sliced or torn into pieces</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Preheat Oven:</b> Preheat your oven to its highest setting (450-500°F or 230-260°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.</li>
            <li><b>Prepare Dough:</b> On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll out your pizza dough to about 12 inches in diameter. Transfer it to a piece of parchment paper dusted with semolina flour or cornmeal to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li><b>Add Toppings:</b> Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the pizza dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Distribute the Fior di Latte mozzarella over the sauce. Drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil over the top and season with a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li><b>Bake:</b> Carefully transfer the pizza (with the parchment paper) onto the preheated pizza stone or a baking sheet. Bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and crispy, and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li><b>Garnish and Serve:</b> Once out of the oven, immediately garnish with fresh basil leaves. Drizzle with a little more extra virgin olive oil if desired. Slice and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
